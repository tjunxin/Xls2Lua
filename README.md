#Xls2Lua

Xls2Lua is a very sample but useful tool,which can convert csv-like Excel files to lua objects! I's mainly suitable for game 
development,especially those whit lua embedded.

##Setup
1. **Python** Make sure you can run `python` command in your command window.You can get Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).By the way,I use Python 2.7.9.
2. **xlrd** Xls2Lua uses [xlrd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd) to read excel files,so you should setup xlrd fitst.If you don't know how to install it, just google it!
3. Copy xls2lua.py to where ever you like.

##How to use
```
python xls2lua inputfile outputfile
```
